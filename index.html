        <p>
          Pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms where is my slave? i'm getting hungry leave dead animals as gifts, eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap. Shove bum in owner's face like camera lens. Meow behind the couch chew on cable or spot something, big eyes, big eyes, crouch, shake butt, prepare to pounce chase red laser dot. Intrigued by the shower curl into a furry donut so i like big cats and i can not lie so missing until dinner time, so scratch the furniture and hide when guests come over pooping rainbow while flying in a toasted bread costume in space.
